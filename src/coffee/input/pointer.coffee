  ###
  Finds the first available spot in the Pointer.touches-array, used for registering the touches as numbers from 0-9.
  In Google Chrome, each touch's identifier can be used directly since the numbers - starting from 0 - are reused, when the a touch is released.
  In Safari however each touch has a unique id (a humongous number), and a function (this) is therefore needed for identifying the touches as the numbers 0-9, which can be used in the Pointer.touches-array.

  @private
  @return {number|boolean} The first available spot in the Pointer.touches-array where a new touch can be registered. If no spot is available, false is returned

  ###
  Checks if an area defined by a geometric shape, or its outside, is hovered by the mouse pointer.
  The shape can be any geometric object that has a contains function (Rectangle, Polygon).

  @param {Math.Rectangle|Math.Polygon|Math.Circle} shape A geometric shape defining the area to check
  @param {boolean} outside [Whether or not to check the outside of the specified area]
  @return {boolean} True if the shape if hovered, false if not
  ###
  shapeIsHovered: (shape, outside) ->
    if not outside and (shape.contains(@mouse))
      return true
    else return true if outside and (not shape.contains(@mouse))
    false

  ###
  Releases a button, and thereby prevents the button from being detected as "pressed" by the isPressed function.
  This function is very useful for preventing one button press from having multiple effects inside the game. For instance on buttons that are placed on top of each other.

  @param {number} button The button to release
  @return {boolean} True if the button has now been released, false if the button was not already pressed
  ###
  release: (button) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: button") if button is undefined #dev

      i++
    unpressed

  ###
  Checks if the mouse pointer is outside the game arena.

  @return {boolean} True if the pointer is outside, false if not
  ###
  outside: ->
    new Math.Rectangle(engine.arena.offsetLeft, engine.arena.offsetTop, engine.arena.offsetWidth, engine.arena.offsetHeight).contains(@mouse.window) is false

  ###
  Resets the mouse cursor, automatically called by the engine before each frame i executed, unless engine.resetCursorOnEachFrame is set to false

  @private
  ###
  resetCursor: ->
    engine.arena.style.cursor = "default"
    return

  ###
  Sets the mouse cursor for the arena.
  By default the mouse cursor will be reset on each frame (this can be changed with the "resetCursorOnEachFrame" engine option)
  Please be aware that not all images can be used as cursor. Not all sizes and formats are supported by all browsers.

  @param {string} A resource string, image path string or css cursor of the cursor
  ###
  setCursor: (cursor) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: cursor") if cursor is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Argument cursor should be of type: string") if typeof cursor isnt "string" #dev
    resource = undefined

    if resource
      cursor = "url('" + resource.src + "') 0 0, auto"

    # Else, if the cursor is not a single word (a css cursor), use the cursor var as direct image path
    else cursor = "url('" + cursor + "') 0 0, auto" unless /^\w*$/.test(cursor)

    # Finally: set the cursor
    engine.arena.style.cursor = cursor
