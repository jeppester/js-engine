@name Engine.CustomLoop
@class A loop class.
Contains a list of functions to run each time the loop executes.
For the loop to be executed, it will have to be added to the current room via the Engine.currentRoom.addLoop.
A loop also has it's own time that is stopped whenever the loop is not executed. This makes it possible to schedule a function execution that will be "postponed" if the loop gets paused.

@property {number} framesPerExecution The number of frames between each execution of the custom loop
@property {function} maskFunction A function that will be run before each execution, if the function returns true the execution proceeds as planned, if not, the execution will not be run
@property {number} time The "local" time of the loop. The loop's time is stopped when the loop is not executed.
@property {number} execTime The time it took to perform the last execution

@param {number} [framesPerExecution=1] The number of frames between each execution of the custom loop
@param {function} [maskFunction=function(){}] A function that will be run before each execution, if the function returns true the execution proceeds as planned, if not, the execution will not be run
###
c = class CustomLoop
  constructor: (framesPerExecution, maskFunction) ->
    @framesPerExecution = (if framesPerExecution is undefined then 1 else framesPerExecution)
    @maskFunction = (if maskFunction is undefined then -> true else maskFunction)

  ###
  Attaches a function to the loop.

  @param {Object} caller The object to run the function as
  @param {function} func The function to run on each execution of the custom loop
  ###
  attachFunction: (caller, func) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: caller") if caller is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Missing argument: func") if func is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Argument func must be of type function") if typeof func isnt "function" #dev
    @functionsQueue.push
      object: caller
      activity: func

    return


  ###
  Queues a function for being added to the executed functions. The queue works as a buffer which prevent functions, that have just been added, from being executed before the next frame.

  @private
  ###
  addFunctionsQueue: ->
    @functions = @functions.concat(@functionsQueue)
    @functionsQueue = []
    return


  ###
  Detaches a function from the loop. If the same function is attached multiple times (which is never a good idea), only the first occurrence is detached.

  @param {Object} caller The object the function was run as
  @param {function} func The function to detach from the loop
  @return {boolean} Whether or not the function was found and detached
  ###
  detachFunction: (caller, func) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: caller") if caller is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Missing argument: func") if func is undefined #dev

    # Search activities and remove function
    i = 0
    while i < @functions.length
      a = @functions[i]
      if a.object is caller and a.activity is func
        @functions.splice i, 1
        return true
      i++

    # Search activities queue and remove function
    i = 0
    while i < @functionsQueue.length
      a = @functionsQueue[i]
      if a.object is caller and a.activity is func
        @functionsQueue.splice i, 1
        return true
      i++
    false


  ###
  Detaches all occurrences of a specific function, no matter the caller.

  @param {function} func The function to detach from the loop
  @return {function[]} An array of detached functions
  ###
  detachFunctionsByFunction: (func) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: func") if func is undefined #dev

    i = @functionsQueue.length
    while i--
      if func is @functionsQueue[i].func
        removeArray.push @functionsQueue.splice(i, 1)

    if removeArray.length
      removeArray
    else
      false

  ###
  Detaches all attached functions with a specific caller

  @param {Object} caller The object the function was run as
  @return {function[]} An array of detached functions

    while i--
      if caller is @functionsQueue[i].object
        removeArray.push @functionsQueue.splice(i, 1)
    if removeArray.length
      removeArray
    else
      false


  ###
  Schedules a function to be run after a given amount of time in the loop.
  If the loop is paused before the execution has happened, the loop's time will stand still, and therefore the scheduled execution will not happen until the loop is started again.

  @param {Object} caller The object with which to run the function (by default the custom loop itself)
  @param {function} func The function to execute
  @param {number} delay The delay in ms
  ###
  schedule: (caller, func, delay) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: caller") if caller is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Missing argument: function") if func is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Missing argument: delay") if delay is undefined #dev

  Executes the custom loop. This will execute all the functions that have been added to the loop, and checks all scheduled executions to see if they should fire.
  This function will automatically be executed, if the loop has been added to the current room, or the engine's masterRoom
