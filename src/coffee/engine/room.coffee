###
Constructor for the Room class

@name Engine.Room
@class A room is the space wherein game objects reside.
A room holds a list of objects to draw, and a list of custom loops.
If a room is set as the engine's current room (engine.currentRoom); its objects will be drawn, and its custom loops will be executed each time the engine's main loop executes.
The engine also has a master room (engine.masterRoom), which is persistent throughout a game (this is the room where you would add persistent objects and custom loops)
@augments View.Container

@property {string} name The name of the room
@property {function} onEntered A function which will be executed when the room is entered
@property {function} onLeft A function which will be executed when the room is left
@property {Object} loops An object containing the custom loops which has been added to the room

@param {string} name The name of the room. You can use this name later, to enter the room or to remove it
@param {function} [onEntered=function () {}] A function to run when the room is entered (set as the engine's current room)
@param {function} [onLeft=function () {}] A function to run when the room is left

module.exports = class Room extends Container
  constructor: (name, onEntered, onLeft) ->
    super()

    @loops = {}
    @paused = false
    @addLoop "eachFrame", new Engine.CustomLoop()
    engine.addRoom this
    return

  ###
  Prevents all the room's loops from being executed, this function is used by the engine before making room transitions
  ###
  pause: ->
    @paused = true
    return

  ###
  Enables the room's loops after again after the room has been paused.
  ###
  play: ->
    @paused = false
    return

  ###
  Updates all the room's loops.

  @private
  ###
  update: ->
    return if @paused
    i = undefined
    for i of @loops
      @loops[i].execute() if @loops.hasOwnProperty(i)
    return

  ###
  Adds a custom loop to the room.
  After being added, the loop will be executed in each frame.

  @param {string} name The name the use for the custom loop in the room. When added the loop can be accessed with: [The room].loops[name]
  @param {Engine.CustomLoop} loop The loop to add
  ###
  addLoop: (name, loop_) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: loop") if loop_ is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Missing argument: name") if name is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("Name is taken: " + name) if @loops[name] isnt undefined #dev
    @loops[name] = loop_
    return

  ###
  Removes a custom loop from the room.

  @param {string} name The name that the custom loop has been added as
  ###
  removeLoop: (name) ->
    throw new Error("Missing argument: name") if name is undefined #dev
    throw new Error("The \"eachFrame\" loop cannot be removed") if name is "eachFrame" #dev
    delete @loops[name]

    return

  ###
  Delete the remove-method which was inherited from View
  ###
  remove: undefined
