  ###
  Used for animating numeric properties of the owner of the function.
  Available easing functions are:
  "linear"
  "quadIn"
  "quadOut"
  "quadInOut"
  "powerIn"
  "powerOut"
  "powerInOut"
  "sinusInOut"

  @param {object} properties An object containing key-value pairs in the following format:<code>
  {
  "[property name]": "[end value]"
  }
  </code>
  @param {object} options An object containing key-value pairs for the animation's option:<code>
  {
  "duraton": "[animation duration (in ms)]",
  "callback": "[callback function]",
  "easing": "[easing function to use]"
  }
  </code>
