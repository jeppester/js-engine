###
Constructor for the View class.

@name Container
@class A class for objects that are to be drawn on the canvas (or to contain drawn objects)
All objects which are drawn on the game's canvas extends the View-class.
@augments Child

@property {Child[]} children The view's children
@property {Container} parent The parent of the view or undefined if the view is an orphan
@property {boolean} drawCacheEnabled Whether or not draw caching is enabled

@param {Child} child1 A child to add to the view upon creation
@param {Child} child2 An other child to add to the view upon creation
@param {Child} child3 A third ...

  ###
  Adds children to a View object. If the object that the children are added to, is a descendant of the current room, the children will be drawn on the stage when added. The added children will be drawn above the current children.

  @param {Child} child1 A child to add to the View object

  ###
  Adds a child to a View object, below an already added child. This means that the inserted child (or children) will be drawn below the child which they are inserted below.

  @param {Child|Child[]} insertChildren Child or array of children to insert before an existing child
  @param {Child} child Current child to insert other children before

  Fetches an array of all the View's children.
  This will not return a pointer, so changing the returned array will not change the View's children.

  Sets theme of an  Children whose theme is not already set, will inherit the set theme. To enforce the theme to all children, use the recursive argument.

  @param {string} themeName The name of the theme to apply as the object's theme
  @param {boolean} [recursive=false] Whether or not the set theme will be applied to children for which a theme has already been set. If this argument is unset, it will default to false

  Removes one or more children from the
