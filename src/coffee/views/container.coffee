Constructor for the View class.

@name Container
@class A class for objects that are to be drawn on the canvas (or to contain drawn objects)
All objects which are drawn on the game's canvas extends the View-class.
@augments Child

@property {Child[]} children The view's children
@property {Container} parent The parent of the view or undefined if the view is an orphan
@property {boolean} drawCacheEnabled Whether or not draw caching is enabled

@param {Child} child1 A child to add to the view upon creation
@param {Child} child2 An other child to add to the view upon creation
@param {Child} child3 A third ...

  Adds children to a View object. If the object that the children are added to, is a descendant of the current room, the children will be drawn on the stage when added. The added children will be drawn above the current children.

  Adds a child to a View object, below an already added child. This means that the inserted child (or children) will be drawn below the child which they are inserted below.

  @param {string} themeName The name of the theme to apply as the object's theme
