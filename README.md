# jsengine

jsengine is an easy-to-use 2d game engine, with asset management, rooms, collision detection etc.

The engine was created with the purpose of making it easier for myself to reuse common components in my games. It also serves as a platform for experimenting with canvas, view lists, collision detection and WebGL etc.

The engine's structure has changed a LOT of times. Therefore some things might be broke, and the inline documentation can be a bit off or missing at places. However; the examples are working as expected, and the source code should be easily understandable.

## How to view examples

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`, this should open your favorite browser
3. In the browser, choose an example among the html-files
