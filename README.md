GETTING JSENGINE STARTED

You can choose either to run JsEngine without a webserver (requires Firefox or Google Chrome), or to place it on a webserver and access it from there.


HOW TO RUN JSENGINE WITHOUT A WEB SERVER

1. Place the JsEngine files anywhere on your computer.

2. Open index.html with Firefox or Google Chrome (Chrome has to be launched with "--disable-web-security"-flag)

3. If a gray webpage with a white 600x400 box appears, everything is working - for examples, see the examples-subfolder.


HOW TO RUN JSENGINE ON A WEBSERVER

1. Place the JsEngine files somewhere on your webserver.

2. Access index.html on the webserver with your favorite HTML5 capable browser.If you run a local webserver and have placed JsEngine in the root of the server, the path will normally be: http://localhost.

3. If a gray webpage with a white 600x400 box appears, everything is working - for examples, see the examples-subfolder.
