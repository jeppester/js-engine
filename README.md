# jsengine

jsengine is an easy-to-use 2d game engine, with asset management, rooms, collision detection etc.

I created the engine with the purpose of making it easier for myself to reuse common components in my games. It has also served as my own platform for learning more about canvas, view lists, collision detection and WebGL etc.

## How to view examples

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`, this should open your favorite browser
3. In the browser, choose an example among the html-files
