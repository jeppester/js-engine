     * @class A room is the space wherein game objects reside.
     *        A room holds a list of objects to draw, and a list of custom loops.
     *        If a room is set as the engine's current room (engine.currentRoom); its objects will be drawn, and its custom loops will be executed each time the engine's main loop executes.
     *        The engine also has a master room (engine.masterRoom), which is persistent throughout a game (this is the room where you would add persistent objects and custom loops)
     * @augments View
     *
     * @property {string} name The name of the room
     * @property {function} onEntered A function which will be executed when the room is entered
     * @property {function} onLeft A function which will be executed when the room is left
     * @property {Object} loops An object containing the custom loops which has been added to the room
     *
	 * @param {string} name The name of the room. You can use this name later, to enter the room or to remove it
	 * @param {function} [onEntered=function () {}] A function to run when the room is entered (set as the engine's current room)
	 * @param {function} [onLeft=function () {}] A function to run when the room is left
